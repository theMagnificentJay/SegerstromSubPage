# SegerstromSubPage Exercise

### Bootstrap

Page is built with bootstrap, mostly containers, col, row, font size, and accordian

### Gulp

Use of gulpfile.js to compile the scss into css. index.scss -> -css/styles.css

### Legacy

indexOLD.html and indexOLD.scss left in project as guide and example of first runthrough on site. Older revision of script.js no longer exists.

### Assets

All img assets are just dropped in the assets folder, no further sorting here.

### Javascript

The accordian function in this file was provided to me from Matt after a jsfiddle walkthrough.

### Comments

I left comments throughout the project, they don't describe detail but do describe or single out components and sections for the project.

## Incomplete

### Nav

Navbar has a responsive issue where when in smaller/est view the nav icons group in a unwanted way.

### Accordian

script.js has an animation for the expanding of the accordian however I am unsure if it actually animates. I see little difference when that part of the code is commented out.

### Footer / ASL

No color for the footer map pin and asl img (both appear gray) and not orange and purple (respectively) when giving the img a color overlay it just applies an overlay to the element and looked goofy as it was just a square of transparent color.
